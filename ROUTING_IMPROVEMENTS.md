# Routing Improvements & Access Control System

## Problem Solved

The system now properly handles user authentication and routing based on their
roles and memberships, ensuring users are directed to appropriate areas and
shown clear messages when access is denied.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Smart User Routing Logic**

Created `getUserRoutingInfo()` function that determines:

- Whether user is a system admin
- What environments they have access to
- Their default environment
- Whether they can access admin panel

### 2. **Proper Access Control**

- **System Admins**: Redirected to `/admin/environments`
- **Regular Users**: Redirected to their assigned environment
- **Users with No Access**: Shown clear "No Access" message
- **Unauthorized Access**: Shown "Access Denied" message

### 3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**

Created dedicated components:

- `AccessDenied`: For unauthorized access attempts
- `NoEnvironments`: For users without any environment access

## Routing Flow

### **Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)**

```
User visits /dashboard
↓
Check user routing info
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ System Admin?                       │
│ Yes → Redirect to /admin/environments│
│ No  → Continue                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Has assigned environments?          │
│ Yes → Redirect to first environment │
│ No  → Show "No Environments" message│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Admin Routes (`/admin/*`)**

```
User visits /admin/*
↓
Check user routing info
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Can access admin?                   │
│ Yes → Show admin content            │
│ No  → Show "Access Denied" message  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Environment Routes (`/[env]/*`)**

```
User visits /[env]/*
↓
Check if environment exists
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Environment exists?                 │
│ Yes → Continue                      │
│ No  → Show "Environment Not Found"  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
↓
Check user access to environment
↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Has access to environment?          │
│ Yes → Show environment content      │
│ No  → Show "Access Denied" message  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Components Created

### **AccessDenied Component**

- Shows when users try to access unauthorized areas
- Customizable title and message
- Provides navigation options (go to dashboard, sign out)
- Clean, professional design

### **NoEnvironments Component**

- Shows when users have no assigned environments
- Displays user email for context
- Provides contact administrator option
- Sign out option available

## Files Modified

### **Core Routing Logic**

- `src/lib/db/environments/get-user-routing-info.ts` (NEW)
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `src/app/admin/environments/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[env]/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `src/middleware.ts` (UPDATED)
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` (UPDATED)

### **UI Components**

- `src/components/auth/access-denied.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/auth/no-environments.tsx` (NEW)

## User Experience Improvements

### **For System Admins**

- ✅ Automatically redirected to admin panel
- ✅ Can access all environments
- ✅ Clear admin interface

### **For Regular Users**

- ✅ Automatically redirected to assigned environment
- ✅ Clear access denied messages if trying to access unauthorized areas
- ✅ Helpful navigation options

### **For Users with No Access**

- ✅ Clear explanation of why they can't access anything
- ✅ Contact administrator option
- ✅ Professional, non-frustrating experience

### **For Unauthorized Access Attempts**

- ✅ Clear explanation of what's required
- ✅ Helpful navigation to appropriate areas
- ✅ Professional error handling

## Security Benefits

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Users can only access areas they're authorized
   for
2. **Environment Isolation**: Users can only access environments they're
   assigned to
3. **Clear Error Messages**: No confusing redirects or blank pages
4. **Proper Authentication**: All routes properly check user authentication
5. **Admin Protection**: Admin areas are properly protected

## Error Handling

### **Graceful Degradation**

- Users without access see helpful messages instead of errors
- Clear navigation options provided
- Professional error pages

### **User-Friendly Messages**

- "Access Denied" instead of technical errors
- "No Access Granted" instead of blank pages
- Clear next steps provided

## Testing Scenarios

### **System Admin Login**

1. Admin logs in → Redirected to `/admin/environments`
2. Can access all environment routes
3. Can access admin panel

### **Regular User Login**

1. User logs in → Redirected to assigned environment
2. Cannot access admin panel (shows access denied)
3. Cannot access unauthorized environments (shows access denied)

### **User with No Access**

1. User logs in → Shows "No Access Granted" message
2. Clear explanation and contact options
3. Professional experience

### **Unauthorized Access Attempts**

1. User tries to access `/admin/*` without admin role → Access denied
2. User tries to access `/[env]/*` without membership → Access denied
3. User tries to access non-existent environment → Environment not found

## Future Enhancements

1. **Environment Switching**: Allow users to switch between assigned
   environments
2. **Role-Based UI**: Show different UI elements based on user role
3. **Audit Logging**: Log access attempts and denials
4. **Bulk User Management**: Admin tools for managing multiple users
5. **Invitation System**: Streamlined user invitation process

The routing system now provides a professional, secure, and user-friendly
experience for all user types while maintaining proper access control and
security.
