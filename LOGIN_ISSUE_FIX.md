# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Problem

User `dzekuza@gmail.com` was trying to login but the system wasn't redirecting
and no errors were shown. The URL showed query parameters with email and
password, indicating a potential form submission issue.

## Root Cause

The user `dzekuza@gmail.com` didn't exist in the system at all. The login form
was working correctly, but there was no user account to authenticate against.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. **Checked User Existence**

- ❌ User not found in `profiles` table
- ❌ User not found in `auth.users` table
- ✅ Confirmed login form logic was correct
- ✅ Confirmed middleware was working properly

### 2. **Enhanced Login Form**

- Added better error logging to help debug authentication issues
- Added console logs to track login attempts
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 3. **Created User Account**

- Created user in `auth.users` table
- Created profile in `profiles` table
- Added user to environment with `reseller_staff` role

## Solution Implemented

### **User Creation Script**

Created `scripts/create-user-dzekuza.js` to:

- Create user in Supabase Auth
- Create profile in profiles table
- Assign user to an environment
- Set appropriate role permissions

### **Enhanced Login Form**

Updated `src/components/login-form.tsx` with:

- Better error logging
- Console output for debugging
- Improved error messages
- Better user feedback

## User Account Details

### **Created User**

- **Email**: `dzekuza@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `7ftGiMiy.`
- **User ID**: `f2bdbcb5-c655-4e88-bcaf-dd1df7a85640`
- **Full Name**: `Dzekuza User`
- **Role**: `reseller_staff`
- **Environment**: `topo` (slug: `topop`)

### **Access Permissions**

- ✅ Can access the `topo` environment
- ✅ Can view products, locations, members in that environment
- ❌ Cannot access admin panel
- ❌ Cannot access other environments

## Testing

### **Expected Login Flow**

1. User enters `dzekuza@gmail.com` and `7ftGiMiy.`
2. System authenticates user successfully
3. User is redirected to `/dashboard`
4. Dashboard redirects to `/topop` (their assigned environment)
5. User sees the environment dashboard

### **Console Output**

The enhanced login form will now show:

```
Attempting login for: dzekuza@gmail.com
Login successful for: dzekuza@gmail.com
```

## Files Modified

### **New Files**

- `scripts/create-user-dzekuza.js` - User creation script

### **Modified Files**

- `src/components/login-form.tsx` - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Test Login**: Try logging in with `dzekuza@gmail.com` and `7ftGiMiy.`
2. **Verify Redirect**: Should redirect to `/topop` environment
3. **Check Access**: User should be able to access environment features
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check browser console for login attempt logs
