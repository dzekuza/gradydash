## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Standard.js rules (2 spaces, no semicolons, camelCase)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components over client components
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the established file structure

### Navigation Rules

- Use `import Link from "next/link"` for all navigation
- Use `const router = useRouter(); router.push(url)` for programmatic navigation
- All routes render inside the dashboard layout - no full refresh
- Sidebar items use Link and highlight active routes
- Partner-based routing: `/[partner-slug]/[section]`

### UI Rules

- Use shadcn/ui components only - no native HTML styling
- Import from `@/components/ui/[component]`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow shadcn/ui design patterns
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Use theme-aware CSS variables (`bg-popover`, `text-popover-foreground`, etc.)

### Theme System Rules

- **CSS Variables**: Use OKLCH color format for all theme variables
- **Component Backgrounds**: Use `bg-popover` for overlays (dialogs, dropdowns)
- **Text Colors**: Use `text-popover-foreground` for overlay text
- **Consistent Theming**: All components must work in both light and dark modes
- **Theme Toggle**: Available in sidebar footer and mobile user menu

### Mobile Responsiveness Rules

- **Bottom Navigation**: Mobile uses bottom navigation bar instead of sidebar
- **Grid Layouts**: Stats grids use 2-column layout on mobile
- **Button Placement**: Action buttons placed under headers on mobile, not inline
- **Table Responsiveness**: Tables stack content vertically on mobile
- **Padding**: Use `px-0 md:px-8` for mobile-first padding

### Table Component Rules

- **Action Buttons**: Place action buttons (Add Product, Invite Users, etc.) in the table toolbar alongside filter and view options, not as separate buttons near page headings
- **DataTable Props**: Use `actionButtons` prop to pass custom buttons to table toolbar
- **Filter Placeholders**: Use `filterPlaceholder` prop for context-appropriate filtering (e.g., "Filter products...", "Filter members...")
- **Mobile Layout**: Use `space-y-4` instead of `flex items-center justify-between` for page headers to ensure proper mobile stacking
- **Row Selection**: Disabled by default (`enableRowSelection: false`) - only enable when bulk actions are needed
- **Default Page Size**: Set to 10 rows (`initialState: { pagination: { pageSize: 10 } }`)
- **Pagination Display**: Show "X total row(s)" instead of selection count, hide "Rows per page" selector

### Data Fetching

- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Use server actions for mutations
- Implement proper error handling
- Use revalidatePath/router.refresh() after mutations
- Partner-scoped data access

### Security Rules

- All routes require authentication
- Partner-based data access control
- Role-based permissions
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Secure API endpoints with RLS

## Registration System

### Two-Tier Account Types

The system supports two distinct account types:

#### 1. Admin Accounts

- **Capabilities**: Create and manage partner dashboards, invite partners, track products
- **Registration**: Requires company name and personal details
- **Dashboard**: Full admin dashboard with partner management
- **Access**: Can create multiple partners and invite team members

#### 2. Partner Accounts

- **Capabilities**: Join existing partner dashboards, track assigned products
- **Registration**: Requires invite code from an admin
- **Dashboard**: Partner-specific dashboard with limited access
- **Access**: Only to assigned partner dashboard

### Invite Codes System

#### For Admins

- **Generate Codes**: Create invite codes with usage limits and expiration dates
- **Share Codes**: Copy codes or direct registration links
- **Track Usage**: Monitor code usage and expiration
- **Manage Access**: Control who can join the partner dashboard

#### For Partners

- **Receive Code**: Get invite code from admin via email, link, or direct sharing
- **Register**: Use code during registration process
- **Join Dashboard**: Automatically join the correct partner dashboard
- **Activate Account**: Complete email verification and partner activation

### Registration Flow

1. **Admin Registration**:
   ```
   User selects Admin → Enters company details → Account created → Partner dashboard created → Redirected to dashboard
   ```

2. **Partner Registration**:
   ```
   User receives invite code → Clicks registration link → Registers as Partner → Email verification → Partner activation → Join dashboard
   ```
