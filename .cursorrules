## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Standard.js rules (2 spaces, no semicolons, camelCase)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components over client components
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the established file structure

### Navigation Rules

- Use `import Link from "next/link"` for all navigation
- Use `const router = useRouter(); router.push(url)` for programmatic navigation
- All routes render inside the dashboard layout - no full refresh
- Sidebar items use Link and highlight active routes
- Partner-based routing: `/[env]/[section]`

### UI Rules

- Use shadcn/ui components only - no native HTML styling
- Import from `@/components/ui/[component]`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow shadcn/ui design patterns
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Use theme-aware CSS variables (`bg-popover`, `text-popover-foreground`, etc.)

### Table Component Rules

- **Action Buttons**: Place action buttons (Add Product, Invite Users, etc.) in the table toolbar alongside filter and view options, not as separate buttons near page headings
- **DataTable Props**: Use `actionButtons` prop to pass custom buttons to table toolbar
- **Filter Placeholders**: Use `filterPlaceholder` prop for context-appropriate filtering (e.g., "Filter products...", "Filter members...")
- **Mobile Layout**: Use `space-y-4` instead of `flex items-center justify-between` for page headers to ensure proper mobile stacking
- **Row Selection**: Disabled by default (`enableRowSelection: false`) - only enable when bulk actions are needed
- **Default Page Size**: Set to 10 rows (`initialState: { pagination: { pageSize: 10 } }`)
- **Pagination Display**: Show "X total row(s)" instead of selection count, hide "Rows per page" selector

### Data Fetching

- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Use server actions for mutations
- Implement proper error handling
- Use revalidatePath/router.refresh() after mutations
- Multi-tenant data access based on business_id

### Security Rules

- All routes require authentication
- Multi-tenant data access control based on business_id
- Role-based permissions
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Secure API endpoints with RLS
