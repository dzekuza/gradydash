# Logout Button Fix Summary

## Problem

The sign out button was not working on the "No Access Granted" page and other
error pages.

## Root Cause

The original LogoutButton component was using client-side navigation which might
not work properly in certain contexts, especially on error pages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Created Multiple Logout Button Options**

#### **SimpleLogoutButton** (`src/components/auth/simple-logout-button.tsx`)

- Enhanced client-side logout with better error handling
- Includes loading state and proper error logging
- Full-width styling for consistency

#### **LogoutFormButton** (`src/components/auth/logout-form-button.tsx`)

- Uses server action for logout
- More reliable than client-side navigation
- Form-based approach ensures proper submission

#### **Server Action** (`src/lib/auth/logout-action.ts`)

- Server-side logout handling
- Proper redirect after logout
- Fallback for client-side issues

### 2. **Updated Components**

#### **NoEnvironments Component**

- Now uses `LogoutFormButton` for reliable logout
- Proper styling and layout
- Clear user feedback

#### **AccessDenied Component**

- Now uses `LogoutFormButton` for reliable logout
- Consistent with NoEnvironments component
- Better user experience

### 3. **Button Features**

#### **Visual Design**

- Full-width button for consistency
- LogOut icon for clear visual indication
- Proper spacing and layout

#### **Functionality**

- Loading state during logout process
- Error handling and logging
- Proper redirect to login page
- Server-side session cleanup

## Testing

### **Expected Behavior**

1. User clicks "Sign Out" button
2. Button shows loading state
3. Session is cleared on server
4. User is redirected to `/login`
5. No more access to protected pages

### **Error Handling**

- If logout fails, error is logged to console
- User is still redirected to login page
- Graceful degradation

## Files Created/Modified

### **New Files**

- `src/components/auth/simple-logout-button.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/logout-form-button.tsx`
- `src/lib/auth/logout-action.ts`

### **Modified Files**

- `src/components/auth/no-environments.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/access-denied.tsx`

## Usage

### **For Error Pages**

```tsx
import { LogoutFormButton } from "@/components/auth/logout-form-button";

// In your component
<LogoutFormButton />;
```

### **For Regular Pages**

```tsx
import { LogoutButton } from "@/components/logout-button";

// In your component
<LogoutButton />;
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Server action ensures logout always works
2. **Consistency**: Same logout behavior across all pages
3. **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback during logout
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of logout failures
5. **Security**: Proper session cleanup on server

The logout button should now work reliably on all pages, including the "No
Access Granted" page.
