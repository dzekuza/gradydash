# Security Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the security fixes and improvements made to the Grady
ReSellOps dashboard.

## Overview

The application has been updated with comprehensive security measures to ensure
proper authentication, authorization, and data protection.

## Authentication Improvements

### Required Authentication

- All routes now require proper authentication
- No unauthenticated access to any dashboard features
- Proper session management and validation
- Secure cookie handling for authentication state

### Session Management

- Secure session tokens with proper expiration
- Automatic session refresh for active users
- Proper logout functionality with session cleanup
- Session validation on all protected routes

## Authorization and Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a comprehensive RBAC system with the following roles:

1. **Grady Admin** (`admin`)
   - Full system access
   - Can create and manage all environments
   - Can manage all users and system settings

2. **Grady Staff** (`grady_staff`)
   - System-wide staff access
   - Can access all environments
   - Limited administrative functions

3. **Reseller Manager** (`reseller_manager`)
   - Full environment management
   - Can invite/remove team members
   - Can manage all products and locations

4. **Reseller Staff** (`reseller_staff`)
   - Can manage products and locations
   - Can view analytics
   - Cannot invite/remove team members

### Environment Access Control

- Users can only access environments they have been invited to
- Environment creators automatically get access to their environments
- System admins have access to all environments
- Proper validation of environment membership

## Data Protection

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All database tables have RLS policies implemented:

- **Environments**: Users can only access environments they're members of
- **Products**: Products are scoped to user's environments
- **Locations**: Locations are scoped to user's environments
- **Memberships**: Users can only see memberships for their environments
- **Invitations**: Users can only see invitations for their environments

### Data Isolation

- Complete data isolation between environments
- No cross-environment data access
- Environment-specific audit trails
- Secure data boundaries

## API Security

### Input Validation

- Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper output encoding
- CSRF protection on all forms

### Rate Limiting

- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request throttling for sensitive operations
- Brute force protection for authentication endpoints
- DDoS protection measures

## Environment Variables Security

### Secure Configuration

- All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- Proper separation of development and production configs
- Secure handling of API keys and tokens

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Database Security

### Secure Schema Design

- Proper foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints on critical fields
- Proper indexing for performance and security
- Audit fields on all tables

### Migration Security

- Secure migration scripts
- No sensitive data in migrations
- Proper rollback procedures
- Version-controlled schema changes

## Frontend Security

### Client-Side Security

- No sensitive data exposed to client
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Secure form handling and validation
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

### Route Protection

- Client-side route guards
- Proper redirect handling for unauthorized access
- Secure navigation between protected routes
- Proper error boundaries

## Email Security

### Secure Email Handling

- Email address validation
- Secure invitation links with expiration
- Rate limiting on email sending
- Proper email template sanitization

### Invitation Security

- Unique, secure invitation tokens
- Time-limited invitation links
- One-time use invitation links
- Email verification for invitations

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Logging

- Authentication attempts logged
- Failed access attempts tracked
- Environment access logged
- Data modification audit trails

### Error Handling

- Secure error messages without information leakage
- Proper error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful error recovery

## Best Practices Implemented

### Code Security

- Regular dependency updates
- Security-focused code reviews
- Proper TypeScript usage for type safety
- Secure coding practices throughout

### Deployment Security

- Secure deployment procedures
- Environment-specific configurations
- Proper secret management
- Regular security audits

## Testing Security

### Security Testing

- Authentication flow testing
- Authorization testing for all roles
- Input validation testing
- SQL injection testing
- XSS testing

### Penetration Testing

- Regular security assessments
- Vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Infrastructure security reviews

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- GDPR compliance considerations
- Data retention policies
- User data export capabilities
- Data deletion procedures

### Privacy

- Minimal data collection
- Transparent data usage
- User consent mechanisms
- Privacy policy compliance

## Future Security Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - TOTP-based 2FA implementation
   - Backup codes for account recovery
   - Optional 2FA for enhanced security

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Automated threat response

3. **Enhanced Encryption**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Encrypted data at rest
   - Secure key management

4. **API Security**
   - API key management
   - Request signing
   - Advanced rate limiting
