# Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the security fixes applied to address vulnerabilities
identified by CodeRabbit.

## 1. Fixed UUID Query Issues in `get-environments.ts`

### Problem

- `id.in.()` with an empty list yields an invalid filter that PostgREST rejects
- UUIDs were not properly quoted, causing parsing issues

### Solution

- Added guard clause to check if `membershipEnvironmentIds` is empty
- When empty, use simple `eq` filter instead of `or` with `in`
- Properly quote UUIDs using `"${id}"` format

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Before: Always used .or() with potential empty list
.or(`created_by.eq.${userId},id.in.(${membershipEnvironmentIds.join(',')})`)

// After: Conditional query building
if (membershipEnvironmentIds.length === 0) {
  envQuery = envQuery.eq('created_by', userId)
} else {
  const quoted = membershipEnvironmentIds.map(id => `"${id}"`).join(',')
  envQuery = envQuery.or(`created_by.eq.${userId},id.in.(${quoted})`)
}
```

## 2. Input Sanitization in `create-environment.ts`

### Problem

- The `name` field was used directly in string interpolation without
  sanitization
- Could lead to XSS attacks if malicious scripts were included

### Solution

- Added HTML tag stripping using regex: `/<[^>]*>/g`
- Applied sanitization to all uses of the name field

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Sanitize name to prevent XSS
const sanitizedName = name?.trim().replace(/<[^>]*>/g, "");

// Use sanitizedName throughout the function
```

## 3. Authentication Enforcement

### Problem

- Demo environments could be created without authentication
- Anonymous users could create unlimited environments, leading to resource
  exhaustion

### Solution

- Removed demo environment creation for unauthenticated users
- Redirect unauthenticated users to login with return URL

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Before: Created demo environments for unauthenticated users
if (!user) {
    // Create demo environment...
}

// After: Redirect to login
if (!user) {
    redirect(
        "/auth/login?redirect=" +
            encodeURIComponent(
                `/create-environment?name=${
                    encodeURIComponent(sanitizedName)
                }&slug=${encodeURIComponent(slug)}`,
            ),
    );
}
```

## 4. RLS Policy Hardening

### Problem

- Users could create environments owned by someone else
- Users could update environments and change ownership

### Solution

- Enforced `created_by = auth.uid()` on INSERT
- Added `WITH CHECK` clause on UPDATE to prevent ownership hijacking
- Added database trigger for additional protection

### Migration: `004_fix_rls_policies.sql`

```sql
-- Enforce creator on INSERT
CREATE POLICY "Users can create environments" ON environments
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (created_by = auth.uid());

-- Add WITH CHECK on UPDATE
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their environments" ON environments
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (created_by = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (created_by = auth.uid());

-- Trigger to make created_by immutable
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION enforce_environment_ownership()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Ensure created_by cannot be changed
  IF OLD.created_by IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.created_by THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'created_by cannot be modified';
  END IF;
  
  -- Ensure created_by is set to current user on INSERT
  IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' AND NEW.created_by IS NULL THEN
    NEW.created_by = auth.uid();
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **✅ Apply the code changes** to the TypeScript files
2. **✅ Run the database migration**:
   ```bash
   # Apply the new migration
   supabase db push
   # Or manually run the SQL in Supabase dashboard
   ```

3. **Test the fixes**:
   - Verify that empty membership lists don't cause query errors
   - Test that XSS attempts in environment names are sanitized
   - Confirm that unauthenticated users are redirected to login
   - Verify that ownership cannot be spoofed or hijacked

## ✅ Migration Status

**Migration `004_fix_rls_policies.sql` has been successfully applied to the
database.**

The following security improvements are now active:

- ✅ RLS policies enforce `created_by = auth.uid()` on INSERT
- ✅ RLS policies prevent ownership hijacking on UPDATE
- ✅ Database trigger makes `created_by` immutable
- ✅ Database trigger defaults `created_by` to `auth.uid()` on INSERT

## Security Benefits

- **Prevents query failures** from empty UUID lists
- **Blocks XSS attacks** through input sanitization
- **Enforces authentication** for environment creation
- **Prevents ownership spoofing** through RLS policies
- **Makes ownership immutable** through database triggers

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for environment
   creation
2. **CAPTCHA**: Add CAPTCHA verification for sensitive operations
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all environment creation and modification attempts
4. **Input Validation**: Add more comprehensive input validation using Zod
   schemas
5. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages to avoid information disclosure
